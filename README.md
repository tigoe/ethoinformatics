This is a repository for code examples for the ethoinformatics project at ethoinformatics.org. At the moment, it's a collection of messy examples, meant for internal use only.

For the openLayers examples, you'll need to download openLayers from http://openlayers.org/

Note: because of the restrictions of JQuery's XMLHttpRequest, you can't run the OpenLayers examples locally, you have to run it through a server. So either put it on your own server or use localhost://
